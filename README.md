Project 3 for Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree Program.

# Program Description
This web utility program enables the users to review information of conferences and their sessions.

It also helps facilitate conference registration and authentication processes for participants.

Authenticated users will have the ability to post, edit, and delete their own items. 

Users can also upload/download documents related to the sessions and mark/unmark their favorite sessions.

This project focuses on using full stack web development skills to build a web app from the scratch, which can perform user authentications and CRUD functionality.
